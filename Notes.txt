----------------------FOR COUNTRY SEPARATOR----------------------
1. Slovakia only has 1 data point which is 32, so it is an outlier
2. For countries that have k=2 being better than k=1, those countries have a much higher amount of 32 or 64 MICs
3. The majority of countries have k=1 being better, but the difference between k=1 & k=2 is negligible
4. On average (minus slovakia) k=1 has 0.05731 better f1-score than k=2 for actual MIC predictions
5. On average (minus slovakia) k=1 has 0.05162 better f1-score than k=2 for +-1 MIC predictions
6. On the average, Random forest performs better than KNN (whether with k=1 or k=2). However, KNN can
	have more spikes of correct predictions with k=2.


---------------------For Random Forest Parameters----------------
1. Pan-genomic paper shows RF do best with 100 trees, and default for sklearn is 100 so that is what we will use.
2. Pan-genomic paper, and sklearn, used pick and replace technique (bootstrapping). We will do the same.
3. Pan-genomic paper had the trees go to maximum depth, and had leaves go till purity (only 1 class at each leaf).
	This is the default as well for sklearn, but I think we should compare this with increasing depths/min-samples-per leaf.
	Can use GridSearch in sklearn to automate the process as well as get graph of results?
4. Pan-genomic paper, as well as sklearn, uses Gini impurity, rather than entropy, to split each branch. We will do this.
5. Since we will be forced to have a train and test set(s) due to splitting data, we will not need to perform out-of-bag estimation.
	This is because it would behave similar to cross-validation, but would not require splitting into train and test. We are already
	doing this though. I do not think we need/can use cross-validation as well since we have the split sets.
	
	
---------------------Notes on data---------------------------------
1. There is a species called species. Its genus varies between: Elizabethkingia, Raoultella, Cedecea, Achromobacter, and more.
2. Some species had "/" in their names. These were replaced with a "-".
3. There was a gene with a ":" in its name. This was replaced with a "-".


--------------------Notes on species separator-----------------------
1. Some species only have 1 data point (EX: Gleum, Indologenes, Morganii). This will either then have 0% or 100% accuracy.
	There will not be any in between. For Random forest, this will be random. For knn, as k increases there is a higher chance
	of accidentally picking the correct answer as most have that one data point being either 32 or 64 MIC.
2. To spot any species that only have 1 data point, their csv file will show as being 5kb in size.
3. Files with 2-3 data points will be 6kb in size.


-------------------NOTES on drug separator---------------------------
1. Cannot perform analysis on this separator until we have 2019 data, or we use 2016-2017 to try to predict 2018.
	This is due to differing MIC value distributions between the drugs.
